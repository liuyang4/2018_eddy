As a consequence of the large speed of sound, the Mach number is typically very low which makes the system difficult to converge. To alleviate this problem, a low-speed preconditioner \cite{turkel1987preconditioned} is implemented in this work.
\begin{align}
\mathbf{P}^{-1} \frac{\partial \mathbf{W}}{\partial t}+\mathbf{R}(\mathbf{W})=0.
\end{align}
The preconditioner for the entropy variables $\mathbf{W}_{0}=[p,u,v,w,S]^{T}$ is
\begin{align} 
\mathbf{P}_{0}=\begin{pmatrix}
\beta^{2}&  0&  0&  0& 0\\ 
 0& 1&  0& 0& 0\\ 
 0&  0&  1&  0& 0\\ 
 0&  0&  0&  1& 0\\ 
 0&  0&  0&  0& 1
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{align}
Since the conservative variables are used in the present work, the preconditioner $\mathbf{P}$ for the conservative variables $\mathbf{W}=[\rho, \rho u, \rho v, \rho w, \rho E]^{T}$ can be computed by,
\begin{align}
\mathbf{P}=\frac{\partial \mathbf{W}}{\partial \mathbf{W}_{0}} \mathbf{P}_{0} \frac{\partial \mathbf{W}_{0}}{\partial \mathbf{W}}.
\end{align}
For optimal preconditioning, $\beta^{2}$ should be proportional to the square of the local Mach number $M$, a reference Mach number $M_{ref}$ is used to avoid singularities at stagnation points. Then the value of $\beta^{2}$ is modified to account for the viscous effects,
\begin{align} 
\beta^{2}_{inv} &= K_{1}M^{2}+K_{2}M^{2}_{ref},  \\
\beta^{2}_{vis} &= (1+2Re^{1/3}_{\Delta x})\beta^{2}_{inv}, 
\end{align}
where $Re_{\Delta x}$ is the cell Reynolds number, $K_{1}$ and $K_{2}$ are constants and set to be $1.0$ in this paper. The final value for $\beta^{2}$ must be less or equal to unity,
\begin{align} 
\beta^{2}=\min(\beta^{2}_{vis},1.0).
\end{align}
When $\beta^{2}$ equals unity, $\mathbf{P}$ is an identity matrix and the preconditioner is switched off.
