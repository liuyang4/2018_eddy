The eddy-preserving limiter scheme has been extended by employing a new limiting algorithm for the interpolation of pressure. The conventional van Albada limiter is inactivated in the interpolation of pressure at smooth extrema. Numerical simulations of three dimensional vortex advection and the BulbT test cases were performed. The comparisons demonstrate that the original and extended eddy-preserving limiter schemes are capable of producing better predictions than the baseline MUSCL scheme, and the extended eddy-preserving limiter scheme has slightly improved over the original eddy-preserving limiter scheme.
