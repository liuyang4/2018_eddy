The eddy-preserving limiter scheme has been extended by employing a new limiting algorithm for the interpolation of pressure. The conventional van Albada limiter is inactivated in the interpolation of pressure at smooth extrema. Numerical simulations of 3D vortex advection and the BulbT test cases were performed. The extended eddy-preserving limiter scheme has been demonstrated to further minimize the dissipation for pressure over the original eddy-preserving limiter scheme.
